# Azure Data Share Lab prerequisites

To ensure a successful experience for the Azure Data Share lab, please ensure that you meet the following pre-requisites:

* **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account**: If you don't have an ADLS Gen2 storage account, see the instructions in [Create an ADLS Gen2 storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-quickstart-create-account).
* **Ownership of Storage account**: Ensure that you are the owner of the created storage account which you'll use during the lab. Note that even if you created the storage account, this does *not* mean that you are the owner of the storage account. See instructions to [add yourself into the owner role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-portal).
* **Azure Data Share account**: Create a new Azure Data Share account by navigating to aka.ms/datashare
